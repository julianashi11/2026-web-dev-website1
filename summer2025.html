            <h2>Graduated High School!</h2>
        <h3 id = "importantDate">June 7, 2025 - I graduated!!</h3>
        <div class = "hideText hidden">
        <p>High school had been some of the best years of my life. So, it definitely felt bitter sweet saying goodbye to my teachers, friends, and classmates. Knowing that I wouldn't see them as often after made this moment extremely bittersweet. I would do anything again to experience a day back in high school.</p>
        <p>Getting leied especially made me emotional as I saw everyone who meant the most in me within a span of an hour. In that moment, I truly realized how lucky I am to be able to experience such a loving enviornment. Surely, I took in all the special moments this night.</p>
        <p>That night, my whole grade went to Dave n Busters, an arcade, and had the time of our lives. I especially enjoyed the hugangous claw machine!</p>

                <p>Not a beach day without a delicious bowl of poke (my fav). Not pictured: fruitful acai bowls.</p>

Beyond my excitement, I felt really grateful for this gesture. Because I was going to go away for college, I wouldn't be able to eat the delicious food that my parents make. So, my dad went out of his way to buy this lobster which made him the best dad ever!</p>
